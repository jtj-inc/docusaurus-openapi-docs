## Prerequisites

1. Postman client <br/><br/>
   > **NOTE**: You can use either the [Postman desktop client](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or web client ([see Postman workspaces](https://www.postman.com/product/workspaces/)). However, this guide will focus on the user experience in the Postman desktop client.
1. An internet connection

## Setup

1. Begin by downloading the [ORC API specification](https://github.com/jtj-inc/docusaurus-openapi-docs/blob/main/demo/examples/ORC.yaml).
   ![Downloading the API specification](..\static\img\getting-started\downloading-spec.png)
1. Next, import the ORC API specification into Postman.
   > **NOTE**: for instructions on how to import an API spec into Postman, see [Importing an API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).
1. In Postman you should now have a collection with the name `Orbital Refuse Collector (ORC) API`.

## Usage

1. Verify that the collection was imported correctly by sending a request. For this example I will send the `Get a list of satellites` request, but you can test with any request.
1. Upon receiving a response, verify the following: <br/>
   a. The response status code was 200. <br/>
   b. You received back either a list of satellite objects in the response body or no response body (depending upon which request you tested). <br/><br/>

## baseURL Configuration
> **NOTE**: By default this collection uses a [Wiremock](https://wiremock.org/) server to simulate all endpoints. If you would like to change this behavior, you can modify the `baseUrl` value in the collection's variables.
